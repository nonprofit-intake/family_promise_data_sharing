# Family Promise of Spokane Data Sharing API
## Project Overview
What happens to local utilities customers that fell behind on payments prior to ceasing to be customers? How can we use our resources to prevent future homelessness?

Our Solution: Design an API that uses unique identifiers to determine whether an ex-customer began receiving services from service providers assisting people experiencing homelessness.

## Tech Stack
Services: AWS, Docker, Jupyter Notebooks, Postman

Languages: Python, SQL

Backend: AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, ElephantSQL

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- SQL
- AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway
- PostgreSQL

### Deployment to AWS
#### Developer environment
Build Amazon Linux image with Python 3.7 and pip

```docker build -t example_image_name .```

#### Installing dependencies

All dependencies are already installed, but if for some reason you needed to delete and reinstall:

```docker run -v $(pwd):/aws -ti example_image_name```

then

```pip install bcrypt aws-psycopg2 pandas -t /aws```

Do not install if these packages already exist in the aws folder.

#### Packaging Lambda Function
```zip -r example_filename.zip *```

At this point you'll want to head over the AWS GUI for function creation at AWS Lambda. 

## Development
